# data_analysis_1
Performed exploratory data analysis on a Kaggle marathon dataset (1798-2022), filtering US marathons of 50km/50mi. Cleaned and formatted data, handled missing values, and optimized readability. Used Seaborn to analyze athlete age, gender, race length, and speed. Introduced a 'race season' parameter to study its impact on athlete speed across age groups.
